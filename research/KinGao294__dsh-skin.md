# dsh-skin

Skin switcher + custom wallpaper + **奶龙桌宠（desktop pet with sticker pack）**
for DeepSeek Harness — a "change the skin" feature in the spirit of Codex
themes. It registers a curated catalog of palettes into DSH's built-in theme
runtime and adds three rows to **Settings → General** (below the built-in
Appearance row):

- **皮肤 / Skins** — pick one of 7 curated palettes (or **默认 / Default** to
  follow the built-in appearance).
- **背景图片 / Wallpaper** — local image, or paste an image/video URL; opacity,
  blur, and fit (cover / contain / stretch / tile).
- **奶龙桌宠 / Pet** — a floating, draggable yellow-dragon desktop pet with an
  8-mood sticker pack (表情包). It follows the agent's running state
  (idle → thinking → working → done → sleeping), blinks while idle, falls
  asleep when idle too long, can be dragged anywhere (position remembered),
  and shows a 🎨 sticker panel where you can pick any mood manually. Toggle it,
  resize it, or reset its position from the settings row.

Both choices persist across reloads (localStorage). A saved third-party skin is
re-applied once on boot (DSH only persists system/light/dark itself).

## How it works

DSH's theme system is token-based: the web shell ships `--dsw-*` design tokens,
and `ThemeRuntime` lets third-party plugins register themes that override the
alias layer (`--dsw-alias-*`) per color scheme. This package is a regular
dual-face plugin:

- **Host half** (`lib/index.js`) — a `dsh.bundle` patch layer that inserts one
  loader entry (`skin`); a no-op `apply`, exactly like the shipped ui-* packages.
- **Browser half** (`lib/client.js`) — a `dsh.client` bundle (served at
  `/plugins/dsh-skin/client.js`) that:
  1. registers 7 curated skins via `ctx.theme.register(...)`;
  2. restores the saved skin id and applies it with `ctx.theme.setTheme(...)`;
  3. renders the wallpaper as a fixed backdrop layer (`z-index: -1`) and stacks
     a token override (`ctx.theme.overrideTokens`) that makes the main canvas
     (`--dsw-alias-bg-base`) and sidebar (`--dsw-specific-sidebar-fill`)
     translucent, so the image shows through while inner surfaces (cards,
     inputs, bubbles) stay opaque and readable;
  4. keeps the slot stores in sync with `theme/change` (and re-shades the
     wallpaper when the active skin or light/dark scheme changes);
  5. mounts both rows into `settings.general.item`;
  6. mounts the desktop pet (a fixed, draggable element with inline-SVG
     stickers) and watches the agent's running state through
     `ctx.get("sessions").list()` to switch moods.

Each skin sets its `colorScheme` (`light`/`dark`), which drives
`body[data-ds-dark-theme]`, plus alias-token overrides applied as inline custom
properties on `<body>` by ui-layout's ThemePresenter.

## Skins

| id        | scheme | vibe                              |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| `skin-ocean` | dark   | DeepSeek-blue deep sea            |
| `skin-graphite`| dark   | neutral monochrome                |
| `skin-forest` | dark   | green calm                        |
| `skin-sunset` | dark   | warm purple                       |
| `skin-midnight`| dark   | pure black OLED                   |
| `skin-paper` | light  | warm paper                        |
| `skin-sakura` | light  | pink accents                      |

Ids are namespaced (`skin-*`) so they do not collide with official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-console` themes (`sakura`, `graphite`). Saved unprefixed ids are migrated on read.

Picking **默认 / Default** reverts to the built-in appearance (follow system)
and clears the stored skin.

## Wallpaper

In **Settings → General → 背景图片 / Wallpaper**:- **选择图片 / Choose image** — pick a local image (≤ 2MB, stored as a data
  URL, kept in this browser only). Local video files are not uploaded; paste a URL instead.
- **网址 / URL** — paste http(s) / data image or video (mp4/webm/ogv/mov). blob is rejected (dies on reload). No extra media server.
- **显示方式 / Fit** — cover / contain / stretch / tile.
- **界面遮罩 / UI wash** and **模糊 / Blur** sliders (rAF-coalesced; no crash). Higher wash = more solid UI.
- **移除 / Remove** clears it.

The wallpaper lives on a `z-index: -1` fixed layer, so it is only visible
through the translucent main canvas and sidebar; message surfaces keep their
solid backgrounds for readability. It also follows your active skin's tint
(switching skins re-shades the translucent surfaces).

## 奶龙桌宠 / Pet

In **Settings → General → 奶龙桌宠 / Pet** you can show/hide the pet, resize it
(64–180 px) and reset its position. Behavior:

- **Status moods** — the dragon follows the agent: `thinking` when a turn
  starts, `working` while it runs, `done` (with sparkles) when it finishes,
  then back to `idle`. Left idle too long it falls asleep (`sleeping`, Zzz).
- **Sticker pack (表情包)** — hover the pet and open 🎨: 8 moods to pick
  (idle / happy / thinking / working / done / sad / surprised / sleeping).
  Clicking the pet also cycles to a random sticker for a few seconds.
- **Draggable** — drag it anywhere; the position is remembered
  (`dsh-skin:pet-pos`). Reset it from the settings row.
- **Zero assets** — every sticker is inline SVG (original hand-drawn art in a
  Nai-Long style, not the licensed character), so the bundle stays dependency-
  free and crisp at any size. `preview.html` in the repo shows the full pack.

## Persistence

Choices are stored in `localStorage` (`dsh-skin:skin`, `dsh-skin:wallpaper`,
`dsh-skin:wallpaper-opacity`, `dsh-skin:wallpaper-blur`, `dsh-skin:wallpaper-fit`,
`dsh-skin:pet-enabled`, `dsh-skin:pet-size`, `dsh-skin:pet-pos`).
DSH's Host settings wire only exposes an allowlisted set of namespaces to
browser clients (`WEB_SETTINGS_NAMESPACES` in `dsh-host-apiproxy`), so a
third-party namespace would answer `settings-not-exposed`; the product itself
keeps remote browser preferences process-local, and localStorage matches that
boundary for a visual preference while surviving reloads on the same origin.

## Install

From anywhere, add the package to the `web` profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add -w /path/to/dsh-skin
```

> The `-w` flag is required: every profile ships a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so
> pnpm 9 treats the profile directory as a workspace root and refuses a bare
> `add` with `ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT`.

This runs pnpm in `~/.dsh/profiles/web`, installs the package, and appends it
to `dsh.profile.bundles` (its patch layer inserts the `skin` loader entry).
The running web server must be restarted to pick up the new bundle layer:

```sh
# stop the running instance, then:
dsh web
```

Open **Settings → General** to use the skins, wallpaper and pet.

## Publishing (npm)

DSH (rc.6) has **no separate plugin marketplace** — the plugin distribution
channel *is* the npm registry. A package that declares `dsh.bundle` (host patch
layer) and `dsh.client` (browser bundle) is exactly what `dsh plugin
--profile <name> add <package>` installs, so publishing this package to npm is
what "上架" means today:

1. Pick a unique name (scoped names are safer, e.g. `@yourscope/dsh-skin`) and
   fill in `author`, `repository`, `keywords`, and a CHANGELOG.
2. Make sure `files` ships `lib/index.js`, `lib/client.js`, `lib/types`,
   `cordis.patch.yml` (already configured).
3. Publish to the **official npm registry** (this machine's default registry is
   a mirror — publishing to a mirror does not reach npmjs):
   ```sh
   npm publish --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
   ```
4. Users install with:
   ```sh
   dsh plugin --profile web add -w @yourscope/dsh-skin
   ```
   then restart `dsh web`.

Known platform boundaries to document for users: browser-side preferences are
stored in localStorage (third-party settings namespaces are not exposed over
the wire yet), and the client bundle may only `require` module-table entities
(platform seeds + registered client bundles).

## Development

The client bundle is written directly in the `__ModuleLoader__` bundle format
(the same shape tsdown emits for the shipped `ui-*` packages), so no build step
is required. `lib/client.js` may `require` only module-table entities: platform
seed words (`react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, …) and registered client bundles
(`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime/client`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-theme/client`,
…). After editing, restart the web server (bundle content is re-hashed and
served with a new `rev`; loader entries are rescanned at boot).
